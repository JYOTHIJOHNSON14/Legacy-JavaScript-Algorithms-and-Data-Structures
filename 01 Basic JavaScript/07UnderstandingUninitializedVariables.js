//Understanding Uninitialized Variables


//Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.

//1. a should be defined and have a final value of 6.
//2. b should be defined and have a final value of 15.
//3. c should not contain undefined and should have a final value of the string I am a String!
//4. You should not change code below the specified comment.


var a=5;
var b=10;
var c="I am a";

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
